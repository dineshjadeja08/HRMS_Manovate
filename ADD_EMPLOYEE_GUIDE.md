    employee_number="EMP004",     # Change this (must be unique)
    phone="+1234567893",          # Change this
    hire_date=date(2024, 10, 1),  # Change this

## Method 3: Using the API (For Integration)

You can also add employees through the API endpoints.

### Step 1: Create Employee
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/employees
Authorization: Bearer {hr_admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "employee_number": "EMP007",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@hrms.com",
  "phone": "+1234567896",
  "hire_date": "2024-10-28",
  "employment_status": "ACTIVE",
  "department_id": 1,
  "position_id": 1,
  "salary": 80000,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Step 2: Create User Account
After getting the employee ID from the response, create a user account:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john.smith@hrms.com",
  "password": "john123",
  "role": "EMPLOYEE",
  "employee_id": 7
}
```

**Note**: User registration endpoint may need to be added to your API if not already present.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Email already exists"
- Each email must be unique
- Check if the email is already in the database
- Use a different email address

### Error: "Employee number already exists"
- Each employee number must be unique
- Use the next available number (EMP007, EMP008, etc.)

### Error: "Department/Position not found"
- Run `list_departments_and_positions()` to see available IDs
- Make sure the IDs exist in your database

### Error: "Database connection failed"
- Make sure your database is running
- Check your `.env` file for correct DATABASE_URL
- Verify the connection string

### Password Requirements
- No minimum length enforced by default
- For production, implement password strength requirements
- Consider using strong passwords (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit passwords to Git**
   - Use environment variables for production
   - Change default passwords immediately

2. **Use strong passwords**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols

3. **Role-Based Access**
   - Give users minimum required permissions
   - Regular employees ‚Üí EMPLOYEE role
   - Team leads ‚Üí MANAGER role
   - HR staff ‚Üí HR_ADMIN role

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Keep track of who creates accounts
   - Log all login attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
